# soccer_form_analysis_cnn_model
 Utilizes a convolutional neural network to track and predict soccer players shooting form. Using the input_to_result.py file any path can be entered to a video of a player shooting  and the model will process the video and return if it is a good, ok, bad, or unrecognizable shot. The process utilizes  mediapipe, cv2, numpy, and other  technologies.
